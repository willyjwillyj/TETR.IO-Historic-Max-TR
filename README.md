# TETR.IO Historic and Max TR.
This repo contains swo scripts to obtain the max TR or a historical TR based on the information available through the (TETR.IO API)[https://tetr.io/about/api/]. This is designed not as a standalone script, but a utility for other scripts or applications to use. 
Timestamps are unix timestamps (seconds since the epoch) as opposed to TETR.IO's timestamps (ms since the epoch)
